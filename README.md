# FinalYearProject_HouseLifeExpectancy

“House Life Expectancy” is a machine learning project to predict the sustainability of a house and to predict the cost that was related to that house. 
While constructing a house, we take multiple things into count and define for how many years can that house be good without any remarks. 
So in this project, we are considering few important things such as 
        soil bearing capacity,
        the loads acting, 
        the quality of cement we are going to use, 
        the type of sand, 
        the number of stairs we are going to build, 
        the concrete mix proportion etc. 
And using these parameters as attributes, we are going to develop a dataset. 
And there will be two other columns which mention the number of years a house can sustain and the price that was related to the house.
The user will be providing the attribute values and the system will predict for how many years the house is going to be good without any fault and the cost that was related to that house.
The libraries that are currently in this system are:
        numpy,
        pandas,
        sklearn,
        flask.
And we have used Visual Studio Code which is a free code editor.
The system will be trained using some records from the dataset. The system will be tested using some other records from the dataset to check whether it is providing the correct results or not. The attribute values will be provided to the system to predict the sustainability of a house and the cost that was related to that house.



TECHNOLOGIES USED:
      flask,
      python,
      html,
      css,
      javascript.
      
      
      
SET UP:
     1. open the code in Visual Studio Code and 
     2. open a new terminal and 
     3. run the installation command for all libraries which are used
        - pip install flask
        - pip install numpy
        - pip install pandas
        - pip install sklearn
     4. run one of the command to open the application in localhost(every system does not accept all of the below commands .i.e, one of the command works to open the website)
        - flask run    (or)
        - python -m flask run     (or)
        - python app.py
